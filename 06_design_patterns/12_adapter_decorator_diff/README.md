Difference between adapter and decorator
=========================================

1. Goal:
    - **Adapter** focuses on interface compatibility
    - **Decorator** focuses on behavior extension.
2. Interface:
    - **Adapter** changes the interface of an object
    - **Decorator** maintains the same interface as the wrapped object.
3. Runtime vs. Compile-time:
    - **Adapters** typically resolve interface mismatches at design or compile time
    - **Decorators** allow adding functionality dynamically at runtime
