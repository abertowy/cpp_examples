Assignment operator and copy constructor
========================================
  
If Copy CTOR is defined and copy assignment operator is not -> it will be generated automatically. And vice versa.  
  
A `copy assignment operator` is a non-template non-static member function with the name `operator=` that can be called with an argument of the same class type and copies the content of the argument without mutating the argument.  
The `copy assignment operator` is called whenever selected by overload resolution, e.g. when an object appears on the **left side** of an assignment expression.  
A `copy assignment operator` is invoked when an assignment operation occurs between two objects that have already been **constructed** (e.g., obj1 = obj2;).  
  
`Copy constructor` is invoked in situations where a **new object** is being initialized **from an existing one**, such as:
- When an object is passed by value to a function.
- When an object is returned by value from a function.
- When a new object is explicitly initialized with an existing object (e.g., MyClass newObj = oldObj; or MyClass newObj(oldObj);).
  
In details:
-----------
1. New Object Creation:  
    The copy constructor creates a new object, while the assignment operator modifies an existing object.
2. Initialization vs. Assignment:  
    The copy constructor is for initialization of a new object, whereas the assignment operator performs assignment between two already existing objects.
3. Compiler-Generated Defaults:  
    Both have default versions implicitly generated by the compiler if not explicitly defined by the programmer. These default versions perform a member-wise copy, which can lead to issues (shallow copies) if the class manages dynamic memory.
4. Rule of Three/Five/Zero:  
    For classes managing resources (like dynamic memory), it is crucial to explicitly define the copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor (the "Rule of Three"). In modern C++, this is extended to the "Rule of Five" to include move constructor and move assignment operator, or ideally, the "Rule of Zero" by using smart pointers and other resource-managing classes to avoid manual memory management.
